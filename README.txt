//----------------------------------------------------------   Game Rules   ----------------------------------------------------------//

MULTIPLAYER 
	Left player is player 1, right player is player 2. 
	Keyboard keys 'SHIFT' and 'SPACE' control player 1 up and down respectively.
	Keyboard keys 'UP ARROW' and 'DOWN ARROW' control player 2 up and down respectively.
	If the ball hits the left arena side, player 2 scores a point, if it hits the right arena side, player 1 scores.
        Whoever reaches 5 score points wins, then the game will reset if player presses enter. 

VERSE COMPUTER
	Same rules as above, however, this time the left player (player 1) is controlled by the computer. 
        Use up and down arrows to control your player paddle (right side). 

SNOW BATTLE (Pong game with a twist!)
	Single player game.
	Use 'SHIFT' and 'SPACE' keys to control left paddle, and up/down arrows to control right paddle.
	Keep the ball within the arena and score points by hitting the ball with the paddles. 
	The snowman deflects the ball and makes it harder to keep the ball in the arena.
	If player reaches 10 points, the snowman will increase speed, and you proceed to level 2.
        If player scores 20 points, the snowman will increase speed again, and you proceed to level 3 (final level).
	Get your highest score by scoring as many points as you can by keeping the ball in the arena!
